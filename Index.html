                    <p><img src="images/Mekka.png">After a very few number of wipes against the mechanist of the alliance, Mekkatorque, the guild has finally downed the formidable boss! While the execution was not perfect, and Atela could be heard weaping in the background, The guild was ecstatic to finally have made some progression. Their raid team will now move on to the Stormwall Blockade encounter. The main raider Brovakiin says the encounter is very easy and similar to the Normal version, but we all know how much he likes to exagerate things... Congratulations to the raiders on there latest kill.</p>

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
